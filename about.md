<p>I’m an AI Engineer with four years of experience in Data Science and Machine Learning. I’m now learning Reinforcement Learning from scratch and writing a series of posts as a personal revision guide. I’ve decided to make these posts public so others can benefit as well.</p>

<p>These posts are created with the assistance of AI. I use several AI tools to study key concepts and research papers; once I fully understand a topic, I add it here in a logical sequence.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or feedback, please email me at the address below.</p>
