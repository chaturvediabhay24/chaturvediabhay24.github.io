title: "Reincarnation: Who is that travels? Atma? Jiva? Subtle body?"
---

In the verse 13 of Bhagwad gita. Sri Krishna explains that "just as a person experiences childhood, youth and old age, the 'indwelling being' acquires another body after death. A wise person is not confused by this."

### Before starting the explaination lets first understand some terms:
1. **Dehi** or **Indwelling Beings** - the one who inhabits a 'Deha' (body)
2. **Atma** - Atma is defined as the one all-pervasive consciousness that dwells within all beings, the consciousness that illumines your mind and reveals your thoughts, emotions and memories. The rishis did not use the word Atma to refer to the entity that leaves a body at death and travels on to a new one. The Atma is not the entity that reincarnates. It is the one all-pervasive consciousness
3. **Shukshma Sharira** or **Subtle body** - It is non-physical, comprising of prana, senses, and mental faculties. This is the entity that leaves the physical body at death and acquires a new one. It is non-physical and includes prana (life force), the five senses, and mental faculties like thinking, memory, and emotions. The sukma sharira rules over the physical body and, at the time of death, takes along all of its parts like prana, mind, and senses to acquire another body.
4. **Sthula sarira** or **Jiva** -  Sanskrit name for physical body

The metaphor illustrates that even though there is only one sun (Paramatma or universal consciousness), there are many reflections of the sun in several buckets (Jivatmas or individual conscious beings). It's the presence of water in each bucket that allows it to reflect the sun. Similarly, it's the presence of the sukshma sharira that allows one to experience the world. When the bucket is empty, it no longer reflects the sun, which represents death. The sun (Atma) still shines on the empty bucket, but there is no reflection because the water (sukshma sharira) is gone



Metaphors:
◦
Bucket and Sun: The sun shining on many buckets of water represents Atma (universal consciousness) being reflected in many individual conscious beings (buckets with water, representing the sukshma sharira). When a bucket is empty (death), the sun (Atma) still shines on it, but there's no reflection because the water (sukshma sharira) is gone.
◦
Computer: The computer hardware (physical body) requires software (sukshma sharira) to be useful. Electricity (Atma) powers the computer, but without the software, the computer is lifeless.
•
Implications: While death seems like a loss, Vedanta teaches that Atma (true self) is eternal and unchanging. Suffering arises from identifying with the physical body and mind (stula and sukshma sharas). Self-inquiry, guided by Vedanta, can lead to the discovery of one's true nature as eternal consciousness, resulting in freedom (moksha) from suffering and false identification
